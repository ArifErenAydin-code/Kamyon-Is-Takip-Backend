The dataset includes 2147 images.
Paragraph are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)
* Auto-contrast via adaptive equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -45 and +45 degrees
* Random shear of between -10° to +10° horizontally and -10° to +10° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.1 percent of pixels
